\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.75cm}
\item Vibration energy harvesting research is not mature yet. Many research challenges still exist in applying the technology.
\item The restrictions and limitations of real world environments must be continually designed around in order to create the best technology possible.
\item Linear harvesters produce more energy in most applications where a clear characteristic frequency is present.
\item Linear time-varying harvesters can increase the bandwidth and the power harvested.
\end{itemize}
